## 2.0.2
*) Minor changes to compile more strictly without any warning. C flags added: -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic .
*) Address sanitizer optative flags (-fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address) if target "sanitizer" is included in command line.
*) Help target prints concise list of targets avalible:
   $ make help

## 2.0.1
New independent phony target "sanitizer" to add the compilation/linking flags to run executables with built in address sanitizer routines.
This special build should be used only for testing and debugging, due these flags slow down heavily the execution.

Improved Makefile and bug fix: The test can now be started automatically after "make test" because the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to ~/Proyecto/boost/lib

## 2.0.0
Tiny boost "beast" web server incorporated to receive commands and print results via web page.

## 1.1.0
New ThreadedMessageQueue that inherits from boost::lockfree::queue<Message*> . This new queue has no lock synchronisation elements in its outer interface.
Older ThreadedMessageQueue was deprecated and eliminated from this project.

## 1.0.0
Original version.
